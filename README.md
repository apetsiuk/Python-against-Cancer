# Python against Cancer
This repository will contain materials and references related to bioinformatics and cancer research.

Hi there! Here is my personal cancer research hobby project. I have no medical or biological degree, so my vision is purely based on data science.

I tried to collect enough theoretical material so that an amateur like me could approach the problem from different angles and make one's little contribution.

The repository will be updated whenever possible. Feel free to join me if you have the same passion and interest.

Thank you, and may the Force be with you!
